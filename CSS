it reduces duplication of styles
it has official NextJS support
it co-locates the styling in the components, reducing cognitive load
it is a standard in the industry that many developers will know
the design system is built into the config, leading to consistent styling
Cons:

it can lead to cluttered looking JSX
it adds a required tech/syntax for new developers to learn in order to contribute
