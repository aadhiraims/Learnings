ESLint is a tool used to enforce rules about coding style and potential errors in JavaScript and TypeScript projects.

Strict Ruleset: The team has chosen a more opinionated set of linting rules. This means that the rules are stricter about how the code should be written and which practices are followed.

Common Plugins: In addition to general ESLint rules, several plugins will be added:

next: This ensures that Next.js-specific practices are followed.

next/web-vitals: Ensures that the code adheres to best practices related to web vitals for performance and user experience.

jsx-a11y: Helps ensure that JSX (JavaScript XML used in React) follows accessibility best practices.

storybook: Enforces rules for writing components and stories in Storybook (a tool for building UI components in isolation).

tsdoc: Enforces documentation standards for TypeScript code, making the codebase better documented and easier to maintain.

typescript-eslint: Ensures TypeScript best practices and syntax are followed.

eslint-plugin-unicorn: This is a more opinionated plugin that enforces a set of coding conventions that are often considered best practices. It is more comprehensive and opinionated than basic linting rules and can be seen as a spiritual successor to well-known style guides like Google's or Airbnb's JavaScript style guides. It takes a strong stance on consistency, readability, and optimization of the code.
